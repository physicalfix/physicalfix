Hi <%= @account.first_name %>,

Welcome to physicalfix.com! Your decision to take advantage of our 14-Day trial brings you one step closer to reaching your health and fitness goals.

Over the next 14 days, you’ll receive 3 workouts per week. You can do each one as many times as you like during that week.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:
Warm up for 5-10 minutes before you begin your workout. Any light activity that gets your blood flowing and muscles warm is fine.
Remember to stretch after you complete your workout. Consistent stretching will help keep you injury free.
As with any exercise program, please consult your doctor before you begin.


Your workouts for this week are waiting for you. Simply log in and click on "Workout #1."  From there, all you have to do is press play and follow along. It’s that simple.

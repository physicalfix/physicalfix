Hi <%= @account.first_name %>,

Welcome to physicalfix.com! Your decision to join our team brings you one step closer to reaching your health and fitness goals.

Every week you'll receive three different workouts. You can do each one as many times as you like during that week.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:
* Warm up for 5-10 minutes before you begin your workout. Any light activity that gets your blood flowing and muscles warm is fine.
* Remember to stretch after you complete your workout. Consistent stretching will help keep you injury free.
* Remember to choose the right weights for each exercise. The weights should be heavy enough to make the last few reps fairly difficult, but not impossible.
* When you complete a workout you'll have the opportunity to submit comments. Please take advantage of this feature. Your feedback will help us perfect your workouts.

As with any exercise program, please consult your doctor before you begin.

Your workouts for this week are waiting for you. Simply log in, click on "Workout #1" and press play. It's that simple.

Let's start shaping your fitness future now!

Have fun,
Your physicalfix.com team

I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank you for your interest in physicalfix.com. As stated on our website, we are finalizing the physicalfix.com system. Once complete, we will be offering a one-of-a-kind personal training service of which we are extremely proud.

The premise of our product is simple. We're here to blend health and fitness into your lifestyle.

By simply signing up you will have access to the following features for free:
* A food journal that makes it easy to track your nutritional intake and stay within your recommended calorie range.
* An interactive weight tracker that allows you to upload pictures so you can visually see your progress.
* An exercise journal that enables you to track your daily activities and your caloric expenditure.

With a small monthly fee, you will have access to our revolutionary Personal Training system. This includes:
* Three unique and customized workouts streamed to your computer every week.  You can do each one as many times as you like within that week.
* A Virtual Training Partner to motivate you and ensure proper form.
* The flexibility to workout whenever and wherever you choose.

We are very anxious to share our product with you and we think you'll be equally excited when you see how effective physicalfix.com can be.

Again, thank you for your interest. I look forward to creating your workouts.

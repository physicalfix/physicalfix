<p><u>Conflict with Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy</u>. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this User Agreement and the Terms and Conditions and/or the Privacy Policy, this User Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning provided for them in the Terms and Conditions and/or the Privacy Policy. This User Agreement, the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Agreement.”</p>

<p><u>Description of Product</u>. PhysicalFix offers two (2) online subscription plans (each a “Subscription Plan” or collectively “Subscription Plans”) through its Website that provides the User with Access to interactive personal fitness and exercise videos (“Videos”) that may be streamed or otherwise transmitted over the Internet. The Subscription Plans are as follows:  (a) the premium tier plan (“Premium Tier”), which provides the User with Access to Videos containing exercise routines that have been customized by a personal trainer for the User; and, (b) the basic tier plan (“Basic Tier”), which provides the User with Access to Videos that are customized for the User utilizing pre-determined exercises, as determined by a database. Access to the Videos pursuant to the Premium Tier or Basic Tier plans is subject to different subscription fees to be paid on a monthly basis (collectively, referred to hereinafter as “Monthly Subscription Fee”), depending on the date on which the User remitted the first Monthly Subscription Fee.</p>

<p>Subject to the foregoing exceptions and upon subscribing to the Premium Tier or Basic Tier plans and subject to the foregoing exceptions, the User must remit the appropriate first Monthly Subscription Fee with respect to the four-week time period the User seeks to be subscribed to the Subscription Plan (“Corresponding Monthly Period”).</p>

<p>With respect to the Premium Tier plan, where the User’s first Monthly Subscription Fee is processed by PhysicalFix’s third party Payment Processor (as defined below) by 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, Access to Videos will commence on the first Monday following the date upon the processing of the first Monthly Subscription Fee. However, where User’s first Monthly Subscription Fee for the Premium Tier plan is processed by PhysicalFix’s third party Payment Processor after 12:01 a.m. on Thursday of any given week, Access to the Videos will commence on the following Monday after that first Monday. Furthermore, PhysicalFix may delay the commencement of Access to Videos in its sole discretion and for any reason at all including, without limitation, PhysicalFix’s inability to contact the User’s physician and/or other medical health care provider.</p>

<p>By subscribing to the Basic Tier plan, Access to the Videos will commence on the first Monday following the date upon which User’s first Monthly Subscription Fee is processed by PhysicalFix’s third party Payment Processor. However, PhysicalFix, in its sole discretion, may provide Access to Videos at some earlier time after User remits the Monthly Subscription Fee with respect to the Basic Tier plan. By PhysicalFix providing Access to Videos at an earlier time as set forth above, this shall in no way alter the manner in which the Corresponding Monthly Period is calculated as set forth below.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Monthly Period will be divided into four (4) seven-day periods (“Time Period” or “Time Periods”), to be determined by PhysicalFix in its sole discretion. Each Time Period in any given four-week period will commence on a Monday (“Commencement Date”). Generally, the Time Periods for the Corresponding Monthly Period will consist of the seven–day period, commencing with the first (4) Mondays following the date upon which the User’s first Monthly Subscription Fee is processed by PhysicalFix’s third party Payment Processor However, where the first Monthly Subscription Fee is not processed by PhysicalFix’s third party Payment Processor by Thursday at 12:01 a.m. and therefore Access to the Videos will commence on the following Monday as opposed to the first Monday following this date, the Time Periods for the Corresponding Monthly Period will consist of the seven-day period, commencing with the following Monday and three consecutive Mondays thereafter.</p>

<p>On the Commencement Date of each Time Period, PhysicalFix will undergo best efforts to provide the User with Access to Videos with respect to the particular Time Period, which Users can Access directly on the Website through their user accounts. PhysicalFix specifically reserves the right to delay providing User with Access to Videos for any reason including, without limitation, PhysicalFix’s inability to contact the User’s physician or other medical health care provider. User will only have Access to the Videos for any particular Time Period during that Time Period. Once a new Time Period commences, User will no longer have Access to Videos from a prior Time Period.</p>

<p>Users acknowledges and agrees that PhysicalFix has fulfilled its obligations pursuant to this User Agreement by making the Videos available for User’s Access through their user account on the Commencement Date of each Time Period.</p>

<p>Users wishing to Access the Videos must: (i) provide PhysicalFix with a User History (as defined below) and/or create an account with the Website, whereby they become registered users (“Registered Users”) or if they already are a Registered User, reaffirm the information submitted in that regard; (ii) pay the appropriate Monthly Subscription Fee; and (iii) comply with any and all other requirements or conditions set forth herein or as otherwise required or requested by PhysicalFix, in its sole discretion.</p>

<p>PhysicalFix reserves the right in its sole discretion to make changes to the requirements and/or conditions set forth above from time to time and without advance notice to User including, without limitation, to the Monthly Subscription Fee, Videos, Website and User Accounts. The same shall be effective immediately upon posting to the Website or notifying User by email of the same. By continuing to Access the Videos, User will be deemed to have consented to those changes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, User hereby acknowledges that the Website, User’s Account and/or Videos may be temporarily inaccessible for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to connectivity problems, server and network downtime and maintenance of PhysicalFix’s servers. Such an inability to Access the Website, User’s account and/or Videos shall not be deemed a breach of this User Agreement by PhysicalFix, nor entitle the User to any damages or injunctive relief against PhysicalFix.</p>

<p><u>Access to the Videos for User’s Personal Use Only</u>. User explicitly agrees that Access to the Videos is solely for his own personal use. User is strictly prohibited from Accessing the Videos for any non-personal use and/or allowing and/or enabling other persons and/or entities to Access the Videos through the User’s account with PhysicalFix (collectively, referred to hereinafter as “Prohibited Non-Personal Use”). Such Prohibited Non-Personal Use include, without limitation: (a) User’s Access to the Videos for all other non-personal purposes including, without limitation, for commercial use and/or sharing the Videos with other persons and/or entities; (b) User’s Access to the Videos for public display purposes including, without limitation, for the purpose of participating or performing the Video with another person or persons; and/or (c) User’s communications of his account information including, without limitation, his log in, username and/or password, to any other person and/or entity for any purpose including, without limitation, for the purpose of allowing and/or enabling other persons and/or entities to Access the Videos. User may Access the Videos from his or her own personal computer and/or from a computer at a different location, provided that the computer has the necessary components to stream the Video, so long as the User is not engaging in Prohibited Non-Personal Use.</p>

<p>User further acknowledges and agrees that PhysicalFix shall have no obligation to provide copies of, or extended Access to, Videos and User shall not Access or attempt to Access any such Video after Access has been restricted by PhysicalFix. PhysicalFix reserves the right to change or update this policy in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to User.</p>

<p><u>Termination</u>. PhysicalFix shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to limit, suspend or terminate this User Agreement, User’s Subscription Plan and/or User’s Access to the Videos at any time and for any reason or no reason at all and without notice to User. Without limitation, if, in PhysicalFix’s sole discretion, it determines that (i) a User is creating potential liabilities, (ii) acting inconsistently with this User Agreement and/or (ii) engaging in Prohibited Non-Personal Use, PhysicalFix may, without limitation, limit, suspend or terminate this User Agreement, Subscription Plan and/or User’s Access to the Videos and/or Website indefinitely. PhysicalFix may also take technical and legal steps to prevent User from Accessing the Videos and/or Website. User otherwise acknowledges and agrees that this is in PhysicalFix’s sole discretion and that it shall not be obligated to do so. PhysicalFix reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against any violation of this User Agreement. All Users agree to cooperate in this investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, User acknowledges and agrees that PhysicalFix can limit, suspend and/or terminate this User Agreement, Subscription Plan and/or User’s right to Access the Videos and/or Website at will, without notice and without cause. Where this User Agreement is terminated by PhysicalFix, all licenses granted to User hereunder shall immediately terminate and User shall immediately cease Accessing the Videos and/or Website and all other PhysicalFix’s products and/or services. In addition, and immediately upon termination of this User Agreement by PhysicalFix, User will no longer have Access to the Videos or any information that he has uploaded to the site including, without limitation, User History (as defined below). Where PhysicalFix limits, suspends or terminates this User Agreement, User’s Subscription Plan and/or User’s Access to the Videos and/or Website in accordance with this provision, User acknowledges and agrees that he shall not receive any refund of the Monthly Subscription Fee, in part or in its entirety, irrespective of when during the respective month such limitation, suspension or termination occurs. This in no way should limit or otherwise affect PhysicalFix’s right to collect unpaid Monthly Subscription Fees due and owing to PhysicalFix by User.</p>

<p>In addition, User will continue to be deemed a subscriber of his respective plan and thereby charged the respective Monthly Subscription Fee unless and until the User terminates this User Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. The User may only terminate this User Agreement directly through the Website, which shall be effective immediately. Upon User’s termination of this User Agreement, PhysicalFix is relieved its obligation to provide any services hereunder including, without limitation, providing Access to the Videos. In addition and in no event shall User be entitled to a refund of the Monthly Subscription Fee, whether in whole or in part, with respect to the Corresponding Monthly Period, irrespective of when during the Corresponding Monthly Period User terminates this User Agreement. Furthermore, where User fails to terminate this User Agreement in the manner set forth above including, without limitation, by providing written notification of same to PhysicalFix via email, regular manner or in some other manner not prescribed above, the User Agreement shall not be deemed effective. In that regard, the User shall still be obligated to remit the Monthly Subscription Fee until User terminates the User Agreement in the manner set forth above.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided otherwise herein, User shall not receive any refund of the Monthly Subscription Fee.</p>

<p><u>User History</u>. Users wishing to Access Videos must first provide PhysicalFix with a complete and accurate User history as required by PhysicalFix in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, medical, health, personal fitness, exercise, diet and/or nutrition-related information (“User History”), which may be utilized by PhysicalFix in customizing User’s Videos pursuant to the Premium Tier and Basic Tier plans. In addition and with respect to subscribing to the Basic Tier plan, the User may also be required to select a category, i.e., elite, average or special populations, which describes the nature and extent of User’s personal fitness training and/or exercise regimen prior and/or at the time of subscribing to this plan. Also, User may also have to indicate whether he consents to the Company discussing his Personal Information with his physician or other medical care provider, as designated by the User. By selecting “Yes” to this inquiry, the User is providing the Company with unfettered permission to contact and disclose, consult and/or discuss User’s Personal Information with his physician or other medical care provider. Specifically and by selecting “No” to this inquiry, the User acknowledges that the Company has complete discretion to deny access and/or registration to the Website and/or subscription to the Subscription Plans. Such information shall also be included in the defined term “User History.” User acknowledges and agrees that all information User provides to PhysicalFix shall be complete, accurate and in no way misleading. User further acknowledges and agrees that he shall immediately notify PhysicalFix in the event that any of the information provided in the User History is, or is suspected, to be or becomes inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or otherwise changes in any respect including, without limitation, information relating to User’s medical and/or health conditions. Such notice shall be made to PhysicalFix in writing and shall include a detailed description identifying: (a) the specific information which is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or no longer accurate or complete; and (b) all information necessary to correct, complete and/or update the same. Furthermore, and without limitation, User shall immediately discontinue Accessing all Videos upon notifying PhysicalFix as required by this provision, and shall not commence Accessing any such Videos unless and until written notice is provided to PhysicalFix by the User’s medical doctor or health care provider stating that there are no risks associated with User’s Access to the Videos. Furthermore, User shall abide by any decision of PhysicalFix with respect to changes in User History or other information, including without limitation, any changes to, or revocation of, any Videos. User acknowledges and agrees that any and all information provided by User, including without limitation, the User History, is deemed a part of this User Agreement, and is hereby expressly incorporated herein.</p>

<p><u>Pricing; Sales; Taxes.</u>  Without limitation, User acknowledges and hereby agrees that by subscribing to the Subscription Plans, User will have to pay a Monthly Subscription Fee with respect to each Corresponding Monthly Period. User acknowledges and agrees that the Monthly Subscription Fee will be paid on a recurring monthly basis through PhysicalFix’s third party Payment Processor (as defined below), in accordance with the terms set forth herein. In that regard and after the User remits the first Monthly Subscription Fee, User hereby authorizes PhysicalFix and/or Payment Processor to automatically charge the User’s account on the monthly anniversary of the date upon which the first Monthly Subscription Fee was remitted (“Anniversary Date”). The Monthly Subscription Fee shall be the rate posted on the Website at the time the User is charged the Monthly Subscription Fee, as that fee may be modified by PhysicalFix in its sole discretion from time to time. However, where PhysicalFix modifies the Monthly Subscription Fee, it will provide email notification to User of the modification to the Monthly Subscription Fee at the email address associated with the User’s account with PhysicalFix. Any modifications to the Monthly Subscription Fee will take effect thirty (30) days after providing such notification to User. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided otherwise herein, User shall not receive any refund of the Monthly Subscription Fee for any reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>In the event that the Monthly Subscription Fee cannot be processed by the Payment Processor for any reason including, without limitation, the User’s credit card has expired and/or is declined, PhysicalFix may terminate this User Agreement without providing notice of same to the User. However, where PhysicalFix continues to render services hereunder to the User including, without limitation, providing Access to Videos, PhysicalFix reserves the right to bill the User directly and charge Interest (as defined below).</p>

<p><b>PhysicalFix will not knowingly accept any order from a person under 18 years of age.</b> In that regard, the User hereby makes the material representation upon which it wishes PhysicalFix to rely that: (i) he is at least 18 years of age; (ii) he is a resident of the United States (iii) he is authorized to subscribe to the Subscription Plan, Access the Videos and/or provide all requested information to PhysicalFix in that regard; and (iv) he is bound to that registration, provision of information or sale and to the PhysicalFix’s applicable cancellation policies, if any. Further, User covenants and agrees to: (i) provide certain information to the PhysicalFix with regard to the mailing address, billing address and other personally identifiable information and User History; (ii) accurately and fully provide any such information; and (iii) provide payment in good and sufficient funds. Verification as to the accuracy of the information provided may be required prior to PhysicalFix’s acceptance of User’s request to subscribe to the Subscription Plan and/or Access the Videos. The User acknowledges that providing his User History to PhysicalFix, subscribing to Subscription Plans and/or remitting a Monthly Subscription Fee, in and of itself, does not obligate PhysicalFix to enroll User into the Subscription Plan and/or provide Access to the Videos to User.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the event that PhysicalFix does not receive payment from the Payment Processor or any credit card company pursuant to which the User has made payment, the User shall be responsible to pay all amounts due to PhysicalFix, upon PhysicalFix’s demand for the same. In the event that the User fails to timely pay any amount due to PhysicalFix, interest (“Interest”) shall accrue at a rate of 18% per annum, or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is less. Interest shall be calculated based upon the total amount that User owes to PhysicalFix at that time. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All prices displayed with respect to the Videos are exclusive of tax and any shipping, are quoted in U.S. Dollars, are valid and effective only in the United States and are subject to change. Any prices listed herein shall be solely for purchases made through the Website. Inadvertent errors in advertised prices are not binding on PhysicalFix and may be adjusted by PhysicalFix at any time in PhysicalFix’s sole discretion. Neither the Website nor PhysicalFix offers any price adjustments based on different sale prices on products or services offered through different sale modalities. Moreover, any sales tax on products or services purchased shall be collected through the Payment Processor (as defined below) as necessary.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <u>Third Party Payment Processor</u>. PhysicalFix utilizes an independent third party service provider, such as Chargify, for the processing of payments with respect to the Monthly Subscription Fee associated with the Subscription Plans (“Payment Processor”). The Payment Processor will process the Monthly Subscription Fee in accordance with its own terms and conditions. For example, the Payment Processor may process the first Monthly Subscription Fee immediately upon User providing his credit card information to the Payment Processor. With respect to subsequent Monthly Subscription Fees, the Payment Processor may process same on the Anniversary Date, however, this is subject to change in the Payment Processor’s discretion. The User will be responsible for reviewing the terms and conditions of any agreement between he and the Payment Processor, which may include the way the Payment Processor collects information, the manner in which they process payments and the duties and obligations that the User has with the Payment Processor. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If the User believes that he has been mistakenly billed, the User has the duty and obligation to notify the Payment Processor immediately of such error.  The User must review the Payment Processor’s policy with regard to their notice requirements.  The User releases the Website and PhysicalFix from all liabilities and claims of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy in billing. Without limitation, User acknowledges and agrees that PhysicalFix has no obligation in regard to a dispute between the User and the Payment Processor, and PhysicalFix need not intercede in any such transaction on a User’s behalf. Moreover, User specifically releases and waives any claim against PhysicalFix arising out of or otherwise related (whether directly or indirectly) to a dispute between User and the Payment Processor.  Without limiting the foregoing, User acknowledges and agrees that PhysicalFix shall not be liable in the event of error, fraud, identity theft or other problems with credit card processing or online payment processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Order Acceptance / Confirmation</u>. User expressly acknowledges and agrees that receipt of the User History, User’s request to subscribe to one of the Subscription Plans and/or the Monthly Subscription Fee from a User does not obligate PhysicalFix to enroll User in a Subscription Plan and/or provide User Access to the Videos. PhysicalFix reserves the right at any time after receipt of the User History, User’s request to subscribe to the Subscription Plans and/or Monthly Subscription Fee from User to accept or reject User’s subscription request and/or provide or not provide Access to the Videos.

The subject line of that email should read: “Failure to Receive Videos.” Failure to provide written notice shall waive any and all claims, including without limitation, claims for any reimbursement of the Monthly Subscription Fee.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <u>Arbitration Demand Procedure</u>. A claim or dispute by a User or PhysicalFix may only be submitted to arbitration if the opposing party is first served with a written demand for same. The party requesting arbitration (the “<b>Requesting Party</b>”) shall provide the opposing party (the “<b>Opposing Party</b>”) with a recommendation for a suggested arbitrator (the “<b>Suggested Arbitrator</b>”) in conjunction with the written demand for arbitration. If the Opposing Party objects to the Suggested Arbitrator, such objection must be set forth in writing and submitted to the Requesting Party within five (5) days, or the objection shall be waived and the Suggested Arbitrator will be deemed appointed. The objection shall be accompanied by the Opposing Party’s recommendation for an arbitrator. The Requesting Party shall have five (5) days to submit his objection to the Opposing Party’s recommendation. Thereafter, should the parties be unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be chosen by a determination of a court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may make a motion for this determination.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <u>Conference, Discovery and Motions</u>.  The arbitrator shall conduct an initial telephone or in-person conference, in the form of a pre-hearing conference to discuss arbitration procedure, within ten (10) days of the arbitrator’s appointment. Both parties to the arbitration shall submit and serve on the other party arbitration statements no later than two (2) days prior to the conference. PhysicalFix and the User shall each have the following procedures available to them, in any order or all at once, with regard to the arbitration: (a) they may each serve up to thirty (30) interrogatories inclusive of subparts which shall be answered within ten (10) days; (b) they may each serve twenty (20) document requests inclusive of subparts which shall be answered within ten (10) days; (c) they may each serve up to thirty (30) requests for admissions which shall be answered within ten (10) days; (d) they may each take up to five (5) depositions, which may be scheduled upon ten (10) days notice, as to which all Parties shall cooperate in producing and locating witnesses (third party witness attendance may be compelled by issuance of a subpoena); (e) they may each serve a summary judgment motion(s) or motion(s) to dismiss on the basis that the matter should be disposed of in whole or in part as a matter of law; and (f) either party to the arbitration may serve a motion(s) to dismiss or suppress based upon a failure to respond to discovery. Such motions may be served at any time twenty (20) days after the arbitrator is appointed. The responding party will have ten (10) days to respond to the motions. The motions shall be heard by the arbitrator and disposed of within ten (10) days thereafter and the arbitrator may allow replies and sur-replies in his discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, service under this Dispute Resolution clause shall be deemed complete upon mailing to a party’s counsel, or if pro se, to the party directly with an additional three (3) day period for service by regular mail. Time shall be deemed of the essence in regard to any procedures set forth herein and any requests for extension shall be considered by the arbitrator only upon a showing of good cause. Oral argument shall not be required unless a party requests it. The standards for deciding motions shall be those set forth under the case law of the court having competent jurisdiction over this matter.

  <p>
    <u>Determination, Award and Costs</u>. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, specific performance of any obligation created under these Terms and Conditions, or the issuance of injunctive relief. The award rendered by the arbitrator in any arbitration under this User Agreement is final and binding on the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof. Each party to the arbitration perform all acts, including the execution and delivery of further documents, as the arbitrator determines is necessary or desirable to confirm and carry out the terms of the award rendered. Each party shall initially bear its own costs, expenses and administrative fees and an equal share of the arbitrator’s fees until such time, if at all, a party is awarded its costs, expenses and fees by the arbitrator. In the event that there is a disproportionate ratio of plaintiffs, defendants or other parties, the arbitrator may consider a reallocation of arbitrator’s fees and expenses in his sole discretion. If either party needs a translator they shall equally bear that expense. If a third party witness requires a translator, the party calling the witness shall bear the expense. Each party shall bear their own travel costs and those of any party or witness they bring. If a party or his attorney does not appear at the arbitration hearing the arbitrator shall strike its claims and/or suppress its defenses and conduct a proof hearing. The arbitration award may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction solely on the basis that the award was arbitrary or capricious.

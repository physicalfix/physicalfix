<p>PhysicalFix, LLC (the “Company”), is committed to protecting the privacy of its Users (as defined below).  This document (“Privacy Policy”) outlines what information the Company collects from its Users through www.physicalfix.com (the “Website”) and how that information is used.  The Company will only keep Users’ information which they submit through the Website for its own internal use.</p>

<h3>Revisions to this Policy </h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to revise, change, amend, alter or modify (“Update”) this Privacy Policy and its other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner.  Any changes shall be effective immediately upon posting. The User, as defined below, is responsible for periodically checking for any Updates of this Privacy Policy by re-visiting the Website and using the “refresh” button on the User’s browser.

<h3>Information Collected</h3>
<p>The information which the Company collects through the Website may include personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) which refers to information that helps it identify users or viewers of the Website (collectively, “Users” and each a “User”).

<p>The Website may also collect data that cannot be traced back to a specific individual (“Anonymous Information”). For example, the Company may be able to keep count of how many Users have viewed the Website and specific content therein, or key words utilized to find the Website, but this information does not necessarily include information regarding Users’ names, street addresses, phone numbers or email addresses. Users who view the Website but do not enter their Personal Information are generally anonymous Users. Only Anonymous Information and no Personal Information will be intentionally collected by the Company from anonymous Users. The Website may use browser cookies to collect Anonymous Information. The Website may also incorporate web beacons or similar tracking technologies to allow the Company to track how the Website is used. Such technologies are used to collect Anonymous Information, e.g. the name of the User’s internet service provider, the IP address of the User’s computer, User’s browser software and operating system, the identity of any linked-form or linked-to website and other similar information. The Company may combine a User’s Anonymous Information with similar information collected from other Users to help improve the Website and the Company’s products and services. </p>

<p>The Company may also keep track of which products or services the User purchases. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not currently knowingly store credit card numbers on its servers. All credit card information and identifying information is processed through an independent third-party, such as Chargify, as made available through the Website (“Payment Processor”). The User acknowledges that the Payment Processor is an independent third party with no affiliation with the Company. Accordingly, the Company cannot attest to or otherwise be responsible for the acts of the Payment Processor, including without limitation, its collection and use of information. User acknowledges that it is solely his responsibility to investigate the Payment Processor’s policies and to ensure that he is satisfied with the same. User provides his information to the Payment Processor at his own risk. Moreover, solely the User will be responsible for complying with the terms and conditions of the User’s agreement with the Payment Processor, which may include, but is not limited to, the way the Payment Processor collects information, the manner in which they process payments and the duties and obligations that the User has with the Payment Processor. The Company does not know of the policies of independent third-parties, including the Payment Processor, and is not responsible for the information collected or how the information is used by any third-parties, including, without limitation, the Payment Processor.</p>

<p>If the User believes that he has been mistakenly billed, the User has the duty and obligation to notify the Payment Processor immediately of such error. The User must review the Payment Processor’s policy with regard to their notice requirement. The User releases the Company and the Website from all liabilities and claims of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy in billing.</p>
